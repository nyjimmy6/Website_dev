            <p>A graduate of Clarion university, majoring in Information Systems and having a minor in Computer Science, web development has always been a hobby and passion of mine.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">Though my career thus far out of school has me on one trajectory, I feel as though my talents are best suited to be a developer. From projects in school to this very website even I
            have been keen on continuing to learn and grow as a web developer. Hopefully by the time anyone reads this, the site you are on will be one full of features and examples of what I can achieve (or do horribly wrong)
